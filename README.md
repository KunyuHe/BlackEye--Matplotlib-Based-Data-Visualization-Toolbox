Project `DarkEyes` is motivated primarily by the need of presentation-ready data visualizations in an applied data science workflow.

Data science professionals who use Python day-to-day might be good at exploratory data analysis (EDA) where plots are mostly for self-use, yet not as good on producing presentation-ready plots that are customized to certain standards or requests. It sometimes takes hours of googling to change a small part of a graph, and even longer to fit the hints to their needs. This might result from the fact that most `Matplotlib` users are not familiar with the package. They use the `Pyplot` API (`plt.plot`) of `Matplotlib` all the time, and have little or no experience interacting with the object-oriented API (`ax.plot`), where users can have full control over the plotting.

`DarkEyes` is here to help. It provides a higher-level user interface that
